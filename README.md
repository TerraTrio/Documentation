I. Introduction

Welcome to TerraTrio! We focus on monitoring and maintaining the grass across the campus of NBSC to promote a healthy, green, and sustainable environment. Through mapping techniques and icons, we showcase the grass, provide area descriptions, display corresponding images, and include the dates of grass cutting. This helps us manage overgrown areas effectively. Together, we are working to make our campus greener, one blade of grass at a time!
